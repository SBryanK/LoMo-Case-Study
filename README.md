# Introduction to Svelte

This is a very small web app to introduce students to the Svelte framework, while playing with data visualisation with D3 and sentiment analysis with TensorFlow.

It is derived from:

- [this observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@jashkenas/sentiment-analysis-with-tensorflow-js)
- [this official TensorFlow example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/sentiment)
- [this example from LayerCake](https://layercake.graphics/example/Line)

The model we are using is here: https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/sentiment_cnn_v1/model.json

And its metadata here: https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/sentiment_cnn_v1/metadata.json

## Read the Svelte documentation

# Context
LoMo is a fabricated department store in Portugal and its online operations focus on a B2B2C model. Small businesses (and individuals) across the country can leverage the platform to connect with customers and utilise its logistics partners (and payment solutions) to close the loop. Once a purchase is completed on the customer side, the seller is notified to fulfill that order. Upon receiving the goods (or estimated delivery date is due), a satisfaction survey is pushed to the customer. The image is a display of the product item page before a customer logs in (and checks out for a given merchandise).


Meanwhile, LoMo operates through its marketing and sales funnel to recruit more sellers in order to enlarge the pool. 

From a potential seller’s perspective, the following steps are involved: 
- Sign up for an account at the landing page
- A LoMo sales development representative (SDR) gets in touch and schedules a consultancy session
- The seller speaks to a sales representative (SR, not SDR) and fromally agrees (sign up confirmed) or aborts (lead not generated)
- A potential candidate (marketing qualified lead, or MQL, in LoMo term) becomes the official seller and starts to set up shop (builds own catalogue with products published into the marketplace)

Dataset for analysis
The setup is inspired by a well-known public source - an e-commerce operation of Brazilain origin. There are over 90k orders and relevant information between 2016 and 2018. Over 8k of marketing qualified leads (MQL’s) were also randomly sampled between 2017 and 2018. These are replicates of real operations data, masked and replacing its business partner profiles with names of Avenger characters.

# CMO challenge: Sales performance and prediction (recommended for internship and campus Associate applicants)

Which product category has the best performance and which has the highest potential?
If you were the Chief Marketing Officer, how would you prioritise your (2C) marketing efforts? Would your strategy differ by region (state)? (Visualising your points on a map would help)

# COO challenge: Delivery performance and (seller) recruitment operations (recommended for experienced Associate applicants)

How would you evaluate current delivery performances? 
How would you revise your SDR/SR operation strategy if you were the Chief Operating Officer taking aforementioned information into account? (for example, what type of SDR/SR should be speaking to what types of potential leads)
